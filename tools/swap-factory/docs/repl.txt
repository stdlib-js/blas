{{alias}}( base, dtype )
    Returns a function which interchanges two vectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base: Function
        Base function which interchanges two vectors. Must have an ndarray
        signature (i.e., must support index offsets).

    dtype: any
        Array data type. The function assumes that the data type of all provided
        arrays is the same.

    Returns
    -------
    fcn: Function
        Function which interchanges two vectors.

    Examples
    --------
    > var fcn = {{alias}}( {{alias:@stdlib/blas/base/dswap}}, 'float64' )
    <Function>


fcn( x, y[, dim] )
    Interchanges two vectors.

    For multi-dimensional input arrays, the function performs batched
    computation, such that the function interchanges each pair of vectors in `x`
    and `y` according to the specified dimension index.

    Both input arrays must have the same shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray
        First input array. Must have at least one dimension and must have the
        same shape as the second input array.

    y: ndarray
        Second input array. Must have at least one dimension and must have the
        same shape as the first input array.

    dim: integer (optional)
        Dimension index along which to interchange vectors. Must be a negative
        integer. Negative indices are resolved relative to the last array
        dimension, with the last dimension corresponding to `-1`. Default: -1.

    Returns
    -------
    y: ndarray
        The second input array `y`.

    Examples
    --------
    > var fcn = {{alias}}( {{alias:@stdlib/blas/base/dswap}}.ndarray, 'float64' );
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( new {{alias:@stdlib/array/float64}}( [ 4.0, 2.0, -3.0, 5.0, -1.0 ] ) );
    > var y = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( new {{alias:@stdlib/array/float64}}( [ 2.0, 6.0, -1.0, -4.0, 8.0 ] ) );
    > fcn( x, y );
    > x.data
    <Float64Array>[ 2.0, 6.0, -1.0, -4.0, 8.0 ]
    > y.data
    <Float64Array>[ 4.0, 2.0, -3.0, 5.0, -1.0 ]
