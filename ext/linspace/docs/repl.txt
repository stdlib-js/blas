{{alias}}( shape, start, stop[, endpoint][, options] )
    Returns a new ndarray filled with linearly spaced values over a specified
    interval along one or more ndarray dimensions.

    If a specified shape has a single element and the function is supposed to
    include the end of the interval, the set of values written to an output
    ndarray only includes the end of the interval, but not the start of the
    interval.

    Otherwise, when a specified shape has a single element and the function is
    not supposed to include the end of the interval, the set of values written
    to an output ndarray only includes the start of the interval, but not the
    end of the interval.

    For real-valued arrays, if the start of the interval is less than end of the
    interval, the set of values written to an output ndarray will be written in
    ascending order, and, if the start of the interval is greater than the end
    of the interval, the set of written values will be in descending order.

    When a specified shape contains at least two values and the function is
    supposed to include the end of the interval, the set of values written to an
    output ndarray is guaranteed to include the start and end interval values.
    Beware, however, that values between the interval bounds are subject to
    floating-point rounding errors.

    When writing to a complex floating-point output array, real-valued `start`
    and `stop` values are treated as complex numbers having a real component
    equaling the provided value and having an imaginary component equaling zero.

    When generating linearly spaced complex floating-point numbers, the real and
    imaginary components are generated separately.

    Both `start` and `stop` are cast to the data type of the output array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape: Array<integer>
        Array shape.

    start: ndarray|number|Complex
        Start of interval. May be either a number, a complex number, or an
        ndarray having a numeric or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray,
        the value must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the
        complement of the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given
        the input shape `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, a start ndarray must
        have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`.
        Similarly, when performing the operation over all elements in a provided
        input shape, a start ndarray must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.

    stop: ndarray|number|Complex
        End of interval. May be either a number, a complex number, or an
        ndarray having a numeric or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray,
        the value must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the
        complement of the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given
        the input shape `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, a stop ndarray must
        have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`.
        Similarly, when performing the operation over all elements in a provided
        input shape, a stop ndarray must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.

    endpoint: ndarray|boolean (optional)
        Boolean specifying whether to include the end of the interval when
        writing values to the output ndarray. May be either a boolean or an
        ndarray having a boolean or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray,
        the value must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the
        complement of the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given
        the input shape `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, an endpoint ndarray
        must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`.
        Similarly, when performing the operation over all elements in a provided
        input shape, an endpoint ndarray must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.
        Default: true.

    options: Object (optional)
        Function options.

    options.dims: Array<integer> (optional)
        List of dimensions over which to perform operation. If not provided, the
        function generates linearly spaced values along the last dimension.
        Default: [-1].

    options.dtype: string|DataType (optional)
        Output array data type. If both `start` and `stop` are real-valued, the
        output array data type may be any floating-point data type or 'generic'.
        However, if either `start` or `stop` are complex-valued, the output
        array type must be a complex floating-point data type or 'generic'. If
        provided, `start` and `stop` are cast to the specified data type. If not
        provided and both `start` and `stop` are the same type (either
        'float64', 'complex64', or 'complex128'), the default output array data
        type is the same type as the input values (either 'float64',
        'complex64', or 'complex128', respectively). Otherwise, if not provided,
        the default output array data type is 'complex128'.

    options.order: string (optional)
        Specifies whether an array is row-major (C-style) or column-major
        (Fortran-style). If `start`, `stop`, and `endpoint` are scalar values,
        the default order is 'row-major'. If `start`, `stop`, and/or `endpoint`
        arrays have the same memory layout, the default order is the same
        layout. Otherwise, the default order is 'row-major'.

    options.mode: string (optional)
        Specifies how to handle indices which exceed array dimensions. If equal
        to 'throw', an ndarray instance throws an error when an index exceeds
        array dimensions. If equal to 'normalize', an ndarray instance
        normalizes negative indices and throws an error when an index exceeds
        array dimensions. If equal to 'wrap', an ndarray instance wraps around
        indices exceeding array dimensions using modulo arithmetic. If equal to
        'clamp', an ndarray instance sets an index exceeding array dimensions
        to either `0` (minimum index) or the maximum index. Default: 'throw'.

    options.submode: Array<string> (optional)
        Specifies how to handle subscripts which exceed array dimensions. If a
        mode for a corresponding dimension is equal to 'throw', an ndarray
        instance throws an error when a subscript exceeds array dimensions. If
        equal to 'normalize', an ndarray instance normalizes negative
        subscripts and throws an error when a subscript exceeds array
        dimensions. If equal to 'wrap', an ndarray instance wraps around
        subscripts exceeding array dimensions using modulo arithmetic. If equal
        to 'clamp', an ndarray instance sets a subscript exceeding array
        dimensions to either `0` (minimum index) or the maximum index. If the
        number of modes is fewer than the number of dimensions, the function
        recycles modes using modulo arithmetic. Default: [ options.mode ].

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = {{alias}}( [ 4 ], 1.0, 4.0 );
    > {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/to-array}}( out )
    [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ]


{{alias}}.assign( out, start, stop[, endpoint][, options] )
    Fills an ndarray with linearly spaced values over a specified interval along
    one or more ndarray dimensions.

    If a provided array has a single element and the function is supposed to
    include the end of the interval, the set of values written to an output
    ndarray only includes the end of the interval, but not the start of the
    interval.

    Otherwise, when a provided array has a single element and the function is
    not supposed to include the end of the interval, the set of values written
    to an output ndarray only includes the start of the interval, but not the
    end of the interval.

    For real-valued arrays, if the start of the interval is less than end of the
    interval, the set of values written to an output ndarray will be written in
    ascending order, and, if the start of the interval is greater than the end
    of the interval, the set of written values will be in descending order.

    When a provided array contains at least two values and the function is
    supposed to include the end of the interval, the set of values written to an
    output ndarray is guaranteed to include the start and end interval values.
    Beware, however, that values between the interval bounds are subject to
    floating-point rounding errors.

    When writing to a complex floating-point output array, real-valued `start`
    and `stop` values are treated as complex numbers having a real component
    equaling the provided value and having an imaginary component equaling zero.

    When generating linearly spaced complex floating-point numbers, the real and
    imaginary components are generated separately.

    Both `start` and `stop` are cast to the data type of the output array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    out: ndarray
        Output array. Must have a numeric or "generic" data type.

    start: ndarray|number|Complex
        Start of interval. May be either a number, a complex number, or an
        ndarray having a numeric or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray,
        the value must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the
        complement of the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given
        the input shape `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, a start ndarray must
        have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`.
        Similarly, when performing the operation over all elements in a provided
        input array, a start ndarray must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.

    stop: ndarray|number|Complex
        End of interval. May be either a number, a complex number, or an
        ndarray having a numeric or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray,
        the value must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the
        complement of the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given
        the input shape `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, a stop ndarray must
        have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`.
        Similarly, when performing the operation over all elements in a provided
        input array, a stop ndarray must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.

    endpoint: ndarray|boolean (optional)
        Boolean specifying whether to include the end of the interval when
        writing values to the output ndarray. May be either a boolean or an
        ndarray having a boolean or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray,
        the value must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the
        complement of the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given
        the input shape `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, an endpoint ndarray
        must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`.
        Similarly, when performing the operation over all elements in a provided
        input array, an endpoint ndarray must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.
        Default: true.

    options: Object (optional)
        Function options.

    options.dims: Array<integer> (optional)
        List of dimensions over which to perform operation. If not provided, the
        function generates linearly spaced values along the last dimension.
        Default: [-1].

        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/zeros}}( [ 4 ] );
    > var out = {{alias}}.assign( x, 1.0, 4.0 );
    > {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/to-array}}( out )
    [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ]
    > var bool = ( out === x )
