{{alias}}( x[, sortOrder][, options] )
    Returns a new ndarray containing the elements of an input ndarray sorted
    along one or more ndarray dimensions using heapsort.

    The algorithm distinguishes between `-0` and `+0`. When sorted in increasing
    order, `-0` is sorted before `+0`. When sorted in decreasing order, `-0` is
    sorted after `+0`.

    The algorithm sorts `NaN` values to the end. When sorted in increasing
    order, `NaN` values are sorted last. When sorted in decreasing order, `NaN`
    values are sorted first.

    The algorithm has space complexity O(1) and time complexity O(N log2 N).

    The algorithm is *unstable*, meaning that the algorithm may change the order
    of ndarray elements which are equal or equivalent (e.g., `NaN` values).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray
        Input array. Must have a real-valued or "generic" data type.

    sortOrder: ndarray|number|string (optional)
        Sort order. May be either a scalar value, string, or an ndarray having a
        real-valued or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray, the value
        must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the complement of
        the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given the input shape
        `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, an ndarray sort order must have a
        shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`. Similarly,
        when performing the operation over all elements in a provided input
        ndarray, an ndarray sort order must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.

        If specified as a string, must be one of the following values:

        - ascending: sort in increasing order.
        - asc: sort in increasing order.
        - descending: sort in decreasing order.
        - desc: sort in decreasing order.

        By default, the sort order is `1` (i.e., increasing order).

    options: Object (optional)
        Function options.

    options.dims: Array<integer> (optional)
        List of dimensions over which to perform operation. If not provided, the
        function performs the operation over all elements in a provided input
        ndarray.

    options.dtype: string|DataType (optional)
        Output array data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( [ -1.0, 2.0, -3.0, -4.0 ] );
    > var out = {{alias}}( x );
    > {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/to-array}}( out )
    [ -4.0, -3.0, -1.0, 2.0 ]


{{alias}}.assign( x, out[, sortOrder][, options] )
    Sorts elements of an input ndarray along one or more ndarray dimensions
    using heapsort and assigns the results to an output ndarray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray
        Input array. Must have a real-valued or "generic" data type.

    out: ndarray
        Output array. Must have a real-valued or "generic" data type.

    sortOrder: ndarray|number|string (optional)
        Sort order. May be either a scalar value, string, or an ndarray having a
        real-valued or "generic" data type. If provided an ndarray, the value
        must have a shape which is broadcast compatible with the complement of
        the shape defined by `options.dims`. For example, given the input shape
        `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dims=[0]`, an ndarray sort order must have a
        shape which is broadcast compatible with the shape `[3, 4]`. Similarly,
        when performing the operation over all elements in a provided input
        ndarray, an ndarray sort order must be a zero-dimensional ndarray.

        If specified as a string, must be one of the following values:

        - ascending: sort in increasing order.
        - asc: sort in increasing order.
        - descending: sort in decreasing order.
        - desc: sort in decreasing order.

        By default, the sort order is `1` (i.e., increasing order).

    options: Object (optional)
        Function options.

    options.dims: Array<integer> (optional)
        List of dimensions over which to perform operation. If not provided, the
        function performs the operation over all elements in a provided input
        ndarray.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        Output array.

    Examples
    --------
    > var x = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/array}}( [ -1.0, 2.0, -3.0, -4.0 ] );
    > var y = {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/zeros}}( [ 4 ] );
    > var out = {{alias}}.assign( x, y );
    > {{alias:@stdlib/ndarray/to-array}}( out )
    [ -4.0, -3.0, -1.0, 2.0 ]
    > var bool = ( out === y )
    true
